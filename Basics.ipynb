The fact that 12 midnight is the time with the 2nd highest level of engagement is interesting, and its explanation is beyond the scope of this project. I know that 'Techies' tend to be night owls, but this probably doesn't fully explain the phenomena. Midnight MST is around midday in China, and so it's feasible that posts are getting engagement from elsewhere in the world, apart from the Americas."

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "Nothing to surprising here. We see the most amount of comments near midday, when most folks are likely stepping away from work for lunchtime. Mid afternoon breaks also seem to influence upvoting/downvoting. Interestingly enough, 8 am Mountain time is the fifth most popular time for point assignage. It feasible that folks are doing some reading during breakfast.\n",

    "The top 5 hours in which **Ask** Posts receive points mirrors what we see for comment times -- that is, most of the action comes during the middle of the day Mountain time. 1 pm is the time that garners the most amount of points on average, similar to how comments are distributed. \n",
    "\n",
    "People also heavily comment in the afternoon heading into the evening, which also appears to be the case with upvoting. That said, people do not as heavily up/downvote in the evening. \n",
    "\n",
    "One glaring difference between the 2 'Top 5' lists is the Midnight hour. The midnight hour saw the 5th most comments, but hasn't generated nearly as many points. Perhaps we can chalk this up to the fact that these commenters, likely on the other side of the world, share something in common that for whatever reason leads them to vote on posts at a much lower rate.
